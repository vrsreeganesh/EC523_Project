# EC523 Project: A Neural-Style-Transfer Approach to Appearance Agnostic Agents

Most of the word was done on SCC. So all the files are present there.
However, I have copied the main scripts into this repository. 

Training Code:  
  train02.py  
    This is the python script that trains the transfuser model.  
  RunTrain02.sh   
    This ist he shell script that takes care of overall training and submits the training as a batch job on SCC.

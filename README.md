# A Style Transfer Approach To Appearance Agnostic Agents

## Abstract
Sim2Real is an approach in robotics where an agent is trained in simulation and deployed in reality. In this project, we investigate Neural Style Transfer as a domain randomization approach to Sim2Real. We present the effectiveness of Neural Style Transfer and how it fares against other SOTA approaches used for Sim2Real.

Most of the word was done on SCC. So all the files are present there.
However, I have copied the main scripts into this repository. 

Training Code:  
  train02.py  
    This is the python script that trains the transfuser model.  
  RunTrain02.sh   
    This ist he shell script that takes care of overall training and submits the training as a batch job on SCC.
